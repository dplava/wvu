Col Lightburn has been ordered to Point Pleasant to take command of the last &amp; the Y companies of his regiment on the Kanawha 3 more companies will be required to fill the regiment one 1 of which I suppose is Daltons[?].  I will be much obliged if you will indicate the companies you have selected and the names &amp; dates of the Lieut Colonel [page 2] &amp; major &amp; adjutant &amp; quartermaster commission 70 so that I may have the entire regimental organization.  For the organization of the next Regt there seems to be nearly companies enough already reported about to ask for a mustering officer.  I beg your excellency to hurry up those organizations. Genl Kelley has been directed as soon as notice is given to detail an officer to muster them in.  Q-Master Ransom will be directed to furnish camp equipage &amp; your Excellency has the clothing &amp; equipment.  Arms to be supplied on requisition by Lieut Crispin who will have orders to that effect  W.S. Rosecrans Brig Genl. USA 163P494pd</dcterms:description>
