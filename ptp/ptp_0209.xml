	<dcterms:description>Gov Peirpoint [Francis H. Pierpont], Wheeling Aug 22nd 1861.   By Telegraph from Clarksburg 22 1861.   Col Frazier called on me today stating that he had been promised a colonelcy but was refused subsequently because I objected to his appointment.  I told him my objection was made because I had supposed he was in too feeble health but that all I presumed to recommend to [page 2] your Excellency was first that we should have physical ability sufficient joined to military knowledge &amp; experience if we  could get it that if we were obliged to take me without military knowledge we should by all means take young men &amp; that I would say this to you.
