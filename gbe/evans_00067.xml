	<dcterms:description>George's 73rd hunting season finds him at nearly 91 years and Kay at 91, while Manton is 6 1/2. Hunting without a gun for much of the season, he visis Little Sandy South, the Pauls' place, June's place, Roaring Creek Bridge, Charlie Seese's land, Hog Run, Livingood Road, and Muddy Creek. He drives to where he shot his first West Virginia grouse in 1939. Many of the old roads are now grown over, showing no signs of use by car, and George expresses concern that he and Kay are no longer in condition to be hunting and traversing slippery, steep hills. When he finally flushes grouse, it happens on the outing when he hunts without a gun, but he is still overjoyed at the prospect of there being grouse in the area. </dcterms:description>
