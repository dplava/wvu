	<dcterms:description>George begins this season with his Old Hemlock dog, Manton, sick due to gravel in his stomach. He begins this season's outings hunting with only Quest, but includes both Quest and Manton in his later hunts.  It is George's 67th season at 84 years old, and his dog Quest's 8th season at 7 years old. George is beginning to experience some health problems, but Kay remains at his side for many hunts. He hunts in locations in and around Black Bear thorns, Mallow North, Rehobeth thorns, the Pauls' place, Mrs. Burkes' land, Mitchell Fields, Spruce Spring, the McKay place, Rich Hopkins' land, and Charlie Seese's land. George visits with Virginia Grover and Dale Davis' son, who speaks to him about grouse he saw. Later, George comes across a man named Bean while hunting who recognizes his name. Included in his journals are tables and charts of hunt data and statistics for each location. </dcterms:description>
