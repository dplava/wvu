	<dcterms:description>George begins this journal by noting that it is his dogs' Ruff's 10th season and Feathers' 5th season. He also hunts along with Shadow and Wilda, two blue spaniels. He hunts for grouse in Chesnut Ridge, Monongahela National Forest, Cooper's Rock State Forest, and Scott Run. He chats with Mrs. Charley Meyers about shooting grouse, and is annoyed that she mistakes it for pheasant. Later in the year, he visits Pittsburgh for shopping and to see the symphony. Towards the end of the season, he details training Shadows and Wilda to point and retrieve. Ruff's paw is stiff and he can't hunt, while Feathers accidentally pierces a leg on a thorn. While hunting, Kay slips downhill holding 2/3 of a gun. George includes many illustrations of grouse in flight and his dogs, and includes charts with statistics about each dogs' retrieves. He makes note of the weather and terrain in many entries.</dcterms:description>
