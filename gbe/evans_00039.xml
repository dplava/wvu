	<dcterms:description>George writes that his dog Bliss has died, while it is Dixie's 12th season and Briar's 1st season after intensive training. Bunny, a new Old Hemlocker, stays at home at the start of the year. George details his outings hunting for grouse and woodcock at locations including Fred Moon, Gates, Mt. Storm, Canaan Mountain, Connelly, Glade Farms Glade, Gibbon's Glade, Winding Ridge, Tub Run, the McGrew Place, and the Bishoff Place. In most entries, he notes the location, the weather, the names of the dogs he is hunting with, and statistics including the number of flushes and shots he attempts. He includes many sketches of his dogs as well as a table with hunt statistics from each location he visits and each individual dog that accompanies him. </dcterms:description>
