	<dcterms:description>George writes that it is his dog Ruff's 13th season and Dixie's 2nd season. It is his 33rd hunting season with his Fox double gun. Along with his other dogs Feathers and Shadows, George hunts for woodcock, pheasant, and grouse. He hunts in and around Willett Swamp, Worley Wright's swamp, Davis, Blackwater Gorge, Cabin Mountain, Devil's Run, Canaan Valley, and Blackwater Park. Sadly, he notes that Ruff is getting old, with slight health problems, and is not out hunting for more than four hours. Feathers and Shadows are better with pheasants than with grouse. He makes note of the terrain and weather in most entries, and includes statistics for each dog. </dcterms:description>
