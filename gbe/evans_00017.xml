	<dcterms:description>George begins his journal with notes about fishing for trout with Kay in Roaring Creek. Later, in the fall, he details hunting with Kay and his dog, Blue. He is accompanied by a new dog, an Old Hemlock named Ruff, whom he is teaching to fetch grouse. He finds that hunting with two dogs is difficult; the two dogs are jealous of each other. Still, he relates many trips hunting for grouse, woodcock, and quail in Hog House Hollow, Chestnut Ridge, Spikers Ridge, Sandy Creek, Laurel Run, Muddy Creek, Brandonville, and Clifton. He sees deer, and reports on Skipper and Beau, two dogs belonging to others. Ruff, the new dog, points to his first grouse at seven months old, and retrieves his first grouse on Thanksgiving Day. Shooting Notes begin on page 2.</dcterms:description>
