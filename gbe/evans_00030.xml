	<dcterms:description>In this journal, George notes that it is Ruff's 14th season, Feathers' 9th season, Shadows' 8th season, and Dixie's 3rd season. It is his 34th season hunting with his Fox double gun. During this year, he makes a trip to Cabin 22 at Canaan Valley. He hunts for grouse and woodcock in and around Canaan Mountain, Stony River Dam, Blackwater, Barnes Run, Scott Place, and Whitsell County. He writes of allowing rabbit hunting at Old Hemlock, and describes different methods of communicating with and training his dogs. Later, he decides not to continue hunting Feathers and Dixie together, and begins pairing Dixie and Shadow together. It is Feathers' last season. He makes note of the terrain and weather frequently, and keeps statistics for each dog.</dcterms:description>
