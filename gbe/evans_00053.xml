	<dcterms:description>George misses the first few weeks of the season due to an ulcer. When he feels well enough to venture out, he is only able to hunt for roughly two hours at a time. Accompanied by his dog, Belton, and his wife, Kay, he hunts in locations in and around Rehobeth Thorns, the Hartman place, the Henckle place, Little Sandy North, Furnace Road, the Lawson land, the Wilkinson place, Lower Hog Run, Hazelton, the Matthews' place, Graveyard Glade, Lake Noel, and Hunting Hills. He meets with friends including Luke Seese, Raymond Seese, the Lawson boys, and Denny Feathers. On his outings, he sees turkeys, but notes that it is a disappointing year for grouse. He mentions that it is difficult for him to keep up with Belton and misses Dixie's range as a gun dog. Later in the season, he finds the back roads too icy to drive. Unlike many of his other journals, George does not include a table of hunt statistics.</dcterms:description>
