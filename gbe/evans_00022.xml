	<dcterms:description>George begins his journals detailing the Indian Summer during October of that year, noting that leaves were falling but many were still on the trees. It is his 26th hunting season, and his dog Ruff's 6th hunting season. With his Fox double gun, he hunts for grouse with Ruff, Wilda,  and Feathers along Roaring Creek, Lick Run, Brandonville, Mason Run, Little Sandy, the Cooper's Rock area, Hazel Run, Rockvelle, Dolly Sods, Petersburg, Crane School Road, and Upper Laurel. Kay takes pictures of George hunting with the dogs with her Retina II camera. George notes that Feathers has been carefully bred but is not a good bird dog quite yet. He makes many notes of the weather and terrain.</dcterms:description>
