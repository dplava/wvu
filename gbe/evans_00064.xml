	<dcterms:description>In his 70th hunting season, George Bird Evans only hunts with Manton, as his dog Quest had passed away earlier in the year. He visits hunt locations including the Matthews' land, Canaan Valley, Raven Rock trail, Black Bear Thorns, Rehobeth, Balsam Run, Timberline cabins, Dolly Sods, the Poplar House, Kitzmiller Hill, Pine Creek, McClintock Ridge, and Little Sandy. George is often critical of Manton's hunting, comparing him to past dogs. Though he remarks sadly that many of his old hunting friends had passed away, he still hunts with Paul Matthews and Tom Kotay. Kay takes many photos of his hunts. George includes a couple pages of hunt data.</dcterms:description>
