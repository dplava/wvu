	<dcterms:description>George writes of his outings hunting for grouse and woodcock, noting the date, weather, and location in each entry.  Along with their dog Belton, Kay accompanies George on many of his hunts, taking both still photos and video. George nostalgically compares Belton to Briar, praising both dogs highly. He remembers working with Dixie, Briar, and Bliss in various coverts he encounters. Later, he praises the performance of four wheel drives in rough weather and terrain. George hunts for grouse and woodcock in and around Plum Place, Upper Wilderness, Maust, Morrison, White Oak, Hoyes Run, Hartman, Ft. Morris Thorns, Little Sandy, Graveyard Glade, Glover, Frank Wright's Place, Wilkinson's Sawmill, Wilburn, Rattlesnake Hill, English Hill, Rehobeth, Rifle Ridge, park Corner, Ridge Road, and the Bayard Graveyard. He includes tables of hunt statistics for each location.</dcterms:description>
