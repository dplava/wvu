	<dcterms:description>This season finds dogs Belton at 10 1/2 years old and Quest at 2 1/2, while George himself is pushing 80. This season features Quest's first retrieve. Beginning his journals in New York State, George hunts in Afton, Hunt Hill, Hardback Knob, Oquagua Lake, Wheeler Road, Woodcock Corner, Jersey Hill, and Willow Court. In West Virginia and Pennsylvania, he hunts in and around Mount Storm, the Corinth dogwood cover, Poplar House, Clyde Davis' place, Rehobeth, Pigeon Roost Road, Arnold Basin, Ray Guthrie's land, AJ McMullen's place, Dinner Bell Corner, Haudershell, Paul Uphold's land, the Paul Liston Mine, the Hartman place, the Peava place, and Ft. Morris thorns. He hunts with and visits Bill McClure, Jim Nestor, Ray Smith, Rick Gyrka, and Dale Seese. He meets a descendant of his old dog, Ruff, who is mixed with what he terms "rough blood," and expresses disappointment in the resulting dog. He also remarks that Quest is a great disappointment as a dog. He includes a table of statistics with numbers and information for each location and dog. </dcterms:description>
