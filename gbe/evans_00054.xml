	<dcterms:description>It is Belton's 9th season, George's 60th on grouse, and Kay's 52nd season. Along with Belton, George hunts with another dog, Quest. He visits locations in and around Hartman Run, the 4H camp, Gregg Knob, Rifle Ridge, Clarence Friends' land, Grassy Ridge, Terra Alta, Backbone Mountain, the Burkes' land, Wagoner Road, the Matthews' place, and the Franks' place. He visits with friends Dale Dawes, Bill Burns Jr., and Ray Guthrie. George admires the rhododendron and hemlock cover, though at 78 he finds climbing hills harder than twenty years earlier. He writes of Kay's photo of their old dog, Briar, appearing in "Gray's Journal." Later in the season, he hurts his shoulder and cannot mount a gun. Unlike many of his other journals, George does not include a table of hunt statistics.</dcterms:description>
